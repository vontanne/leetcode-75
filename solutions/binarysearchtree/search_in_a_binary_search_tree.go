/*
700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the
subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:

	Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
	Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:

	Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
	Output: []

Constraints:
	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
	- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^7
	- root is a binary search tree.
	- 1 <= val <= 10^7
*/

func SearchBST(root *TreeNode, val int) *TreeNode {
	current := root

	for current != nil {
		if current.Val == val {
			return current
		}

		if val < current.Val {
			current = current.Left
		} else {
			current = current.Right
		}
	}

	return nil
}

/*
Time Complexity: O(h)
	- h is the height of the BST.

Space Complexity: O(1)
	- Iterative traversal uses constant extra space.
